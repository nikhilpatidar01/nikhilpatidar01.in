                Hello! I'm Nikhil Patidar, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and penetration tester with a keen interest in web application security, network security, and offensive security. I love exploring vulnerabilities, understanding how systems work, and helping organizations strengthen their defenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in cybersecurity started with a curiosity about how things could be broken and, more importantly, how they could be made secure. I enjoy participating in CTFs, conducting security research, and continuously learning new techniques and technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving threat landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am dedicated to making the digital world a safer place, one penetration test and vulnerability discovery at a time.
